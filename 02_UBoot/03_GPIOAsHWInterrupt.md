Great! Since you're dealing with a **hardware interrupt** triggered by a GPIO pin (e.g. a switch connected to a physical pin), here's how to handle it **correctly in a Linux kernel driver**. This guide assumes you're working on a custom embedded board with proper GPIO and interrupt controller support in the kernel.

## ‚úÖ What is a Hardware Interrupt?

A **hardware interrupt** is an electrical signal sent from a hardware device (e.g., GPIO pin when switch pressed) to the CPU, telling it to stop what it's doing and run an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.

When a **GPIO** pin is interrupt-capable (e.g., edge-triggered), Linux can map that to an IRQ line using platform-specific code and Device Tree.

## üí° Steps to Implement Hardware Interrupt on GPIO Pin

### 1. üìë Device Tree Binding (DTS)

Make sure the GPIO pin is defined as interrupt-capable in the board `.dts`:

```dts
gpio-keys {
    compatible = "gpio-keys";

    switch1: switch@1 {
        label = "switch1";
        gpios = <&gpio1 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
        linux,code = <KEY_ENTER>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
        interrupts = <5 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
    };
};
```

You can also do it under a custom device node if you're writing your own driver.

### 2. üß† Kernel Driver Code

Here‚Äôs a real example of **registering a GPIO interrupt** in a platform driver:

#### a. Get GPIO and IRQ number

```c
int gpio = of_get_named_gpio(np, "gpios", 0);
gpio_request(gpio, "switch1");
gpio_direction_input(gpio);

int irq = gpio_to_irq(gpio); // Convert GPIO to IRQ number
```

#### b. Request IRQ

```c
ret = request_irq(irq, irq_handler,
                  IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING | IRQF_SHARED,
                  "switch_irq", NULL);
```

> Replace `IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING` with rising or both as needed.

---

### 3. ‚ö° IRQ Handler Function

```c
static irqreturn_t irq_handler(int irq, void *dev_id)
{
    pr_info("Hardware Interrupt: Switch pressed!\n");
    return IRQ_HANDLED;
}
```

Keep this fast! Offload work to a **tasklet**, **workqueue**, or **threaded IRQ** if processing is long.

---

### 4. üßπ Cleanup in `remove()` function

```c
free_irq(irq, NULL);
gpio_free(gpio);
```

## ‚úÖ Important Kernel APIs

| API                                         | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `gpio_to_irq()`                             | Converts GPIO pin number to IRQ number |
| `request_irq()`                             | Registers interrupt handler            |
| `free_irq()`                                | Frees the IRQ                          |
| `gpio_request()` / `gpio_direction_input()` | Setup GPIO pin                         |
| `IRQF_TRIGGER_*`                            | Set edge/level triggering type         |

---

## üß™ Testing

1. Recompile kernel or load module
2. Use `cat /proc/interrupts` to confirm IRQ is registered
3. Press switch ‚Üí observe `dmesg` for log:

   ```
   Hardware Interrupt: Switch pressed!
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips

* Ensure pinmux is correctly set to **GPIO function** (check in `.dts` or IOMUX settings).
* Use `devm_gpio_*` and `devm_request_irq()` for managed resources.
* Check if IRQ is shared (`IRQF_SHARED`) for GPIOs on SoCs.
* Use `irq_set_irq_type(irq, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING)` if not from DTS.
