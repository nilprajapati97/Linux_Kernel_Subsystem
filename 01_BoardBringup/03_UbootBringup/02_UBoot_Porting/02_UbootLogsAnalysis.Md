Great â€” I'll walk you through **U-Boot porting logs with full explanations** step-by-step. Let's assume we are porting U-Boot to a real SoC like **Qualcomm SDM660** or something similar (e.g., i.MX6 or AM335x for general explanation).

### âœ… Log Breakdown
==============================================================================================================================
| **Log**                                     | **Explanation**                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `U-Boot SPL 2022.10...`                     | SPL version and build timestamp. SPL (Secondary Program Loader) is running (part of MLO).         |
| `Trying to boot from MMC1`                  | SPL is attempting to load U-Boot proper (u-boot.img) from the eMMC/SD card (device index 1).      |
| `spl: mmc boot device`                      | Confirming that MMC is the boot target device.                                                    |
| `Card did not respond to voltage select!`   | SPL failed to negotiate voltage with the SD card. Indicates hardware issue or bad init sequence.  |
| `spl: mmc init failed with error: -95`      | MMC initialization failed. Error `-95` is `-EOPNOTSUPP`. Driver doesn't support this card/config. |
| `SPL: failed to boot from all boot devices` | SPL tried all configured boot devices (eMMC, SPI, NAND) and failed.                               |
| `### ERROR ### Please RESET the board ###`  | Board is halted. Needs a reset. Indicates SPL did not find/load u-boot.img successfully.          |

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `U-Boot SPL...`                      | SPL is executing from BootROM â†’ MLO â†’ SPL                                 |
| `Trying to boot from MMC1`           | SPL is looking for u-boot.img in first MMC (usually SD/eMMC)              |
| `reading u-boot.img`                 | Reads the full U-Boot image (U-Boot proper) from FAT/EXT FS or raw offset |
| `Jumping to U-Boot`                  | SPL transfers execution control to U-Boot                                 |
| `U-Boot 2022.10...`                  | Now U-Boot proper is running (with full drivers, CLI, etc.)               |
| `CPU: SDM660 Quad...`                | Detected CPU via SoC registers                                            |
| `DRAM: 2 GiB`                        | DRAM initialized and size detected (via SDRAM/DDR init code)              |
| `MMC: sdhci@...`                     | MMC controller detected and initialized                                   |
| `Loading Environment from MMC... OK` | Loads `uEnv.txt` or U-Boot environment vars from flash                    |
| `Hit any key to stop autoboot`       | Countdown for entering U-Boot shell                                       |
| `Booting from mmc...`                | Autoload path: `/boot/zImage` and `/boot/*.dtb`                           |
| `## Flattened Device Tree blob...`   | Kernelâ€™s DTB is being used (passed via register to Linux)                 |
| `Loading Kernel Image...`            | Kernel is being loaded to RAM (0x80008000 or so)                          |
| `Starting kernel...`                 | `bootm` or `booti` hands over execution to Linux Kernel                   |

| `bootargs`           | Kernel parameters like console=, root=             |
| `bootm` or `booti`   | Boot kernel (legacy uImage or zImage + DTB)        |
| `mmc dev 0; fatload` | Load image from SD card partition                  |
| `printenv`           | View U-Boot environment                            |
| `setenv bootargs`    | Set kernel boot arguments                          |
| `saveenv`            | Persist environment to flash                       |

Would you like a **real dump of `printenv`**, or how to build your own `u-boot.img` from source for your board?

I can also walk through how to use `boot.scr`, `uEnv.txt`, and U-Boot scripts in your boot flow.
