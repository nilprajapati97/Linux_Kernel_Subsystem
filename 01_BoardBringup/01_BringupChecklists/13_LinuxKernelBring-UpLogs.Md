## üîç **Boot Log Breakdown: Stage-by-Stage**

### 1. **Bootloader Phase (U-Boot)**

```plaintext
U-Boot 2018.03 ...
DRAM:  2 GiB
MMC:   sdhci@7824900: 0
```

* Shows U-Boot version.
* DRAM and MMC initialization.

```plaintext
Loading Kernel Image ...
Loading Device Tree ...
```

* Kernel and `.dtb` loaded to RAM.

---

### 2. **Kernel Entry and Early Output**

```plaintext
Starting kernel ...
[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0
[    0.000000] Linux version 5.10.0 ...
```

* Kernel execution begins at address specified by U-Boot.
* Shows detected CPU and kernel version.

---

### 3. **Early Console (Early Printk)**

```plaintext
[    0.000000] earlycon: msm_serial0 at MMIO 0x78af000
[    0.000000] printk: bootconsole [msm_serial0] enabled
```

* Early debugging via UART even before full tty driver is ready.
* This is controlled by `earlycon` or `CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK`.

---

### 4. **Hardware Detection & Init**

```plaintext
[    0.020000] Detected SDM660 SoC
[    0.030000] smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...
```

* Multiprocessor init (shows how many cores are up).
* Detects your SoC (e.g. SDM660).

---

### 5. **Driver Probing**

```plaintext
[    0.080000] Serial: 8250/16550 driver ...
[    0.090000] msm_serial 78af000.serial: ttyMSM0 at MMIO ...
[    0.100000] printk: console [ttyMSM0] enabled
```

* Real serial driver takes over from earlycon.
* `ttyMSM0` = serial console on Qualcomm boards.

---

### 6. **Storage / Filesystem Mount**

```plaintext
[    0.130000] mmcblk0: mmc0:0001 SD16G 14.4 GiB 
[    0.150000]  mmcblk0: p1 p2
[    0.160000] EXT4-fs (mmcblk0p2): mounted ...
```

* MMC controller initialized.
* Detects SD card partitions (p1 = boot, p2 = rootfs).
* Mounts root filesystem (`/`).

---

### 7. **Root Filesystem & Init**

```plaintext
[    0.170000] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) ...
[    0.190000] Run /sbin/init as init process
```

* Root filesystem is active.
* Runs the first userspace process (`init` or `systemd`).

---

### 8. **Systemd/Init Start**

```plaintext
[    0.200000] systemd[1]: System initialization complete.
```

* Userland services are now in control.

## ‚úÖ Tips for Reading Boot Logs

| What to Look For         | Why It‚Äôs Important                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `earlycon`/`bootconsole` | Confirms early debug UART is working.             |
| SoC or board detection   | Ensures `.dts` is loading correctly.              |
| Peripheral probe logs    | Tells if drivers like MMC, Ethernet are ready.    |
| Filesystem mounted       | Confirms rootfs path and mount success.           |
| `Run /sbin/init`         | Ensures transition to user space.                 |
| Panic / hang / no output | Indicates possible device tree or bootarg issues. |

Would you like:

* A **real boot log from an SDM660 board**?
* A **checklist for debugging boot failures** (no UART, no rootfs, etc.)?
* A **device tree example** for UART + MMC?
