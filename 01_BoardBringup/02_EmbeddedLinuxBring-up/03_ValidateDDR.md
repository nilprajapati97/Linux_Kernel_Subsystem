Validating **DDR memory timings** is a critical step during **board bring-up**, especially when porting U-Boot or Linux to a new hardware platform. This ensures your DDR (DDR3/DDR4/LPDDR) controller and PHY configuration is correct and stable under stress.

# 🧪 DDR Memory Validation Using Test Tools – In-Depth Guide

---

## 📌 Why Validate DDR?

* SoC vendors provide **DDR PHY + controller configuration** based on layout, speed, and chip specs.
* Incorrect timing may **boot** the board but cause:

  * **Random crashes**
  * **Data corruption**
  * **Kernel panics**

> 🎯 Goal: Stress DDR with test patterns, confirm stability across voltage/temp variations.

## ✅ When to Validate?

| Stage                   | Purpose                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| After board bring-up    | Ensure stable DDR init    |
| After porting U-Boot    | Validate SPL’s DDR config |
| In manufacturing/QC     | Test every unit           |
| After PCB layout change | Timing may be impacted    |

---

## 🧠 Key DDR Timing Parameters (simplified)

| Term | Meaning             |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| tCL  | CAS Latency         |
| tRCD | RAS to CAS delay    |
| tRP  | Row Precharge time  |
| tRAS | Row Active time     |
| tRFC | Refresh Cycle Time  |
| tWR  | Write Recovery Time |

These are set in the **DDR controller registers** (typically via U-Boot SPL or early init scripts).

## 🛠️ Tools for DDR Testing

| Tool Name                       | Stage                | Interface                               | Usage                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **U-Boot mtest**                | Pre-Linux            | U-Boot shell                            | Simple memory test         |

| **memtool / devmem2**           | Linux userspace      | Terminal                                | Low-level register pokes   |
| **BIST/BIT**                    | SoC-level HW         | Built-in self test in DDR PHY (NXP, TI) |                            |
| **custom memory pattern loops** | Bare-metal or U-Boot | Serial console                          | Used during bring-up       |

## 🔧 A. Testing DDR in **U-Boot** using `mtest`

### ✅ Why U-Boot?

* If Linux won’t boot, test memory **before kernel comes up**.
* U-Boot’s SPL is responsible for **DDR training/config**.

### 🔹 Command:

```bash
=> mtest start_addr end_addr [pattern] [iterations]
```

### 🔹 Example:

```bash
=> mtest 0x80000000 0x81000000 0xA5A5A5A5 10
```

* Writes and reads back pattern
* Reports any mismatches (address, expected, actual)

### 📌 Notes:

* Start with small ranges and increase
* Use multiple patterns (`0x0`, `0xFF`, `0xA5A5`, `0x5A5A`)
* Run for 1000+ iterations in soak test

---

## 🔧 B. Testing DDR in **Linux** using `memtester`

### 🔹 Install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install memtester
```

*(or cross-compile for embedded boards)*

### 🔹 Usage:

```bash
memtester 512M 10
```

* Tests 512MB of RAM with 10 iterations

### 🔹 Output:

```text
Pattern tests:
  Stuck Address       : ok
  Random Value        : ok
  Checkerboard        : ok
  Bit Spread          : ok
  Walking Ones/Zeros  : ok
```

### 📌 Notes:

* Don’t use 100% RAM – leave room for kernel processes
* Run overnight if possible for stress

---

## 🔧 C. Use `devmem2` for Low-Level Access

```bash
devmem2 0x80000000 w 0xA5A5A5A5
devmem2 0x80000000
```

> Not a test tool, but helps you inspect **register values** for debugging DDR controller config.

---

## 🧬 D. PHY-Specific Built-In Test (BIST)

### Many SoCs (NXP i.MX, TI K3) have **DDR PHY BIST mode**, allowing:

* HW-level stress test with pseudorandom data
* Eye diagram generation (on eval boards)
* Margin testing (voltage/temp/EMI)

### Example: **TI AM6x DDRSS controller**

```bash
=> ddr diag run test all
```

### Example: **NXP i.MX8 DDR tool**

* Provided by NXP for calibration + testing
* Generates .ds script or binary
* Can be run from U-Boot or JTAG

---

## 🔄 E. Bare-metal DDR Test Loop (Custom)

```c
volatile unsigned int *p = (unsigned int *)0x80000000;
for (int i = 0; i < 0x100000 / 4; i++) {
    p[i] = 0xAAAAAAAA;
}
for (int i = 0; i < 0x100000 / 4; i++) {
    if (p[i] != 0xAAAAAAAA) {
        printf("Mismatch at %p: %08x\n", &p[i], p[i]);
    }
}
```

* Can be run from SPL, or in early U-Boot
* Useful for very early validation
