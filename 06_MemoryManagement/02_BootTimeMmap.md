Here is a **complete flow of `mmap()`** from **boot-time memory allocation in a device driver** to **user-space access**, as applicable in **Embedded Linux (BSP level)** — especially for a **10-year experienced developer**.

---

### 📍 **Overview**

We’ll cover the entire flow:

```
[1] Boot-Time: Driver allocates memory (DMA/coherent/normal)
[2] Driver implements mmap() in file_operations
[3] Application calls mmap() on driver node
[4] Kernel maps physical to user-space virtual memory
[5] User accesses the memory
```

---

## ✅ \[1] Boot-Time: Memory Allocation in Kernel Driver

You can use several methods in your driver to allocate memory:

### 📌 Example: DMA-Coherent Memory (for hardware buffers)

```c
void *kbuf;
dma_addr_t dma_handle;

kbuf = dma_alloc_coherent(dev, BUF_SIZE, &dma_handle, GFP_KERNEL);
```

* `kbuf` → kernel virtual address
* `dma_handle` → physical address for device
* Suitable for **zero-copy user access** with `mmap()`

---

## ✅ \[2] Implement `mmap()` in Your Device Driver

### 📌 Register mmap in `file_operations`

```c
static const struct file_operations my_fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .mmap = my_mmap,
};
```

### 📌 Implement `mmap` callback

```c
static int my_mmap(struct file *filp, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
    unsigned long size = vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;

    if (size > BUF_SIZE)
        return -EINVAL;

    return remap_pfn_range(vma,
                           vma->vm_start,
                           virt_to_phys(kbuf) >> PAGE_SHIFT,
                           size,
                           vma->vm_page_prot);
}
```

* `remap_pfn_range()` maps **physical pages** into user **virtual space**
* `virt_to_phys()` is used to get physical address of `kbuf`
* Kernel sets up the **page tables**

---

## ✅ \[3] User-Space mmap() Call

### 📌 User app

```c
int fd = open("/dev/mydrv", O_RDWR);
void *ptr = mmap(NULL, BUF_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
```

* Calls into **libc → kernel → driver → `my_mmap()`**
* No actual data copy!
* Memory is directly mapped to user-space.

---

## ✅ \[4] Kernel Page Table Setup

### When mmap() is called:

* Kernel finds the `vm_area_struct` of the region
* Validates size, permissions
* Calls `remap_pfn_range()` to map **physical pages** into **user's virtual memory**
* This updates the **page table entries** for the calling process

---

## ✅ \[5] User Accesses Memory

Now, user can:

```c
ptr[0] = 0xAB;
memcpy(ptr, data, 256);
```

* Accesses are direct — memory writes go to the kernel-allocated buffer
* If memory was DMA-safe, hardware can also read/write it

## 🔐 Security and Access

* You should mark memory `non-cached` or `device` via `pgprot_noncached()` if needed.
* Driver should validate `offset`, `length`, `permissions` in `mmap()`.

## 🧪 Test Example

### Kernel Module:

```c
#define BUF_SIZE PAGE_SIZE
static void *kbuf;

static int my_mmap(struct file *filp, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
    return remap_pfn_range(vma,
        vma->vm_start,
        virt_to_phys(kbuf) >> PAGE_SHIFT,
        BUF_SIZE,
        vma->vm_page_prot);
}

static int __init my_init(void)
{
    kbuf = kmalloc(BUF_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
    // register char device with my_mmap
}
```

### User App:

```c
int fd = open("/dev/mydrv", O_RDWR);
char *ptr = mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
ptr[0] = 'A';  // Writes to kernel memory
```

| 2    | Implements `mmap()` using `remap_pfn_range()` |
| 3    | User calls `mmap()` on `/dev/mydrv`           |
| 4    | Kernel sets up user virtual memory mapping    |
