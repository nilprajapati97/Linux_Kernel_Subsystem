To understand **External Memory Interface (EMI)** access through a **Linux Device Driver**, you need to grasp how **hardware memory-mapped regions** are exposed to the **kernel** and then potentially to **user-space**. This topic is **commonly asked in interviews** when working with embedded SoCs, external SRAM/Flash, FPGAs, or custom hardware connected via EMI.

---

## üî∑ What is External Memory Interface (EMI)?

An **External Memory Interface** allows a processor (e.g., ARM in SoC) to connect to **external memory devices**:

* Static RAM (SRAM)
* NOR Flash
* NAND Flash (via controller)
* FPGA registers
* Parallel bus memory-mapped devices

The external memory is often **memory-mapped** into the processor's **address space**, usually configured via **bootloader or SoC firmware (e.g., U-Boot, Device Tree)**.

---

## üî∑ Goal: Access EMI from Linux Device Driver

We want to:

1. Map EMI physical memory region (e.g., 0x80000000) into kernel space
2. Perform read/write operations on it
3. (Optional) Map it to user space via `mmap()`

---

## üî∑ Real-World Use Case

Say an external SRAM or FPGA is connected to your SoC and available at **0x80000000** physical address.

### üîπ 1. **System/Bootloader Setup (e.g., U-Boot)**

* Memory controller (EMIF/EBI) is configured at boot time
* You allocate a region for EMI like 0x80000000 - 0x8000FFFF
* This is mapped into SoC‚Äôs physical address space

---

### üîπ 2. **Device Tree Setup**

Create an entry in the device tree to describe the hardware memory-mapped region:

```dts
emi_device: emi@80000000 {
    compatible = "myvendor,myemi";
    reg = <0x80000000 0x10000>; // 64KB
};
```

---

### üîπ 3. **Linux Platform Driver Probe**

The driver is matched using the `compatible` string:

```c
static const struct of_device_id emi_of_match[] = {
    { .compatible = "myvendor,myemi", },
    {},
};

static int emi_probe(struct platform_device *pdev) {
    struct resource *res;
    void __iomem *regs;

    // Get memory region from DT
    res = platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, 0);
    if (!res)
        return -ENODEV;

    // Map physical address to kernel virtual
    regs = devm_ioremap_resource(&pdev->dev, res);
    if (IS_ERR(regs))
        return PTR_ERR(regs);

    // Example: read/write EMI registers
    u32 val = ioread32(regs + 0x10);
    iowrite32(val | 0x01, regs + 0x10);

    pr_info("EMI mapped and accessed!\n");
    return 0;
}

static struct platform_driver emi_driver = {
    .probe = emi_probe,
    .driver = {
        .name = "myemi",
        .of_match_table = emi_of_match,
    },
};
module_platform_driver(emi_driver);
```

### üîπ 4. **I/O Functions to Access Memory**

Use proper MMIO-safe APIs:

| Operation      | API Function                |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Read 32-bit    | `ioread32()`                |
| Write 32-bit   | `iowrite32()`               |
| Read 8/16-bit  | `ioread8()`, `ioread16()`   |
| Write 8/16-bit | `iowrite8()`, `iowrite16()` |

---

### üîπ 5. **Optional: Expose to User Space via `mmap()`**

You can map EMI registers to user space using `remap_pfn_range()`:

```c
static int emi_mmap(struct file *filp, struct vm_area_struct *vma) {
    unsigned long phys = 0x80000000; // EMI base
    unsigned long size = vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;

    if (remap_pfn_range(vma,
                        vma->vm_start,
                        phys >> PAGE_SHIFT,
                        size,
                        vma->vm_page_prot)) {
        return -EAGAIN;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## üî∑ Notes for Interview

### ‚úÖ When to use `ioremap()` vs `kmalloc()`?

* `ioremap()` ‚Üí for mapping device physical memory (not managed by kernel)
* `kmalloc()` ‚Üí for kernel-allocated RAM

---

### ‚úÖ What happens if we access EMI with normal pointer?

* It can crash or give undefined results due to caching, MMU, and alignment issues.
* Always use `ioread32/iowrite32` for MMIO.

---

### ‚úÖ How is EMI memory protected?

* `ioremap()` marks memory as **non-cacheable**
* Kernel ensures proper page attributes (PTE bits)

---

### ‚úÖ Can DMA be done with EMI memory?

* Only if the EMI supports DMA and the controller is integrated.
* Usually, you‚Äôd map EMI memory for CPU polling access, not DMA.

---
