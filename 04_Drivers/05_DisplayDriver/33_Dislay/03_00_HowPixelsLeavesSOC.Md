Perfect topic 🚀 — this is exactly where **decoded pixels** leave software land (framebuffer/CRTC/DRM) and physically travel out of the SoC to the **panel glass** you see. Let’s go step by step, then I’ll break it down into **block-wise explanation** at the end.

## 🔍 Step 3: How Do Pixels Leave the SoC?

The bridge between **software pixels** and **real light on the screen** is the **MIPI DSI Host Controller**.

---

### 1️⃣ Inside the SoC: Framebuffer → CRTC → Encoder

* The **CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller, legacy name)** reads pixel data from the framebuffer.
* It decides **timing**: when does a new line start, when does VSync happen, etc.
* Pixel stream is still “raw” — like an endless sequence of RGB data + sync signals.
* DRM framework then hands this pixel stream to an **encoder**.

🧠 Analogy:
CRTC = “I’ve got frames, here’s the exact sequence of pixels to display.”
Encoder = “I’ll put it into a format your physical link understands.”

### 2️⃣ The Role of MIPI DSI Host Controller

The **MIPI DSI Host** is the specialized block in your SoC that speaks **DSI protocol**.
It performs:

1. **Packetization** – takes raw pixel stream and chops it into **short packets** (commands, syncs) and **long packets** (pixel payload).
2. **Protocol Wrapping** – adds headers, ECC, CRC for error detection.
3. **Timing Control** – makes sure packets align with panel’s **line/frame timings**.
4. **Lane Management** – splits data across multiple DSI lanes (1, 2, or 4 lanes).
5. **Modes** –

   * **Video Mode**: stream pixels nonstop, like HDMI.
   * **Command Mode**: send register writes + partial screen updates (used in smartphones for low power).

---

### 3️⃣ The PHY Layer: MIPI D-PHY / C-PHY

* The **MIPI PHY** is the electrical interface.
* Converts parallel packets from DSI Host into **high-speed differential signals**.
* Uses **Low-Power (LP) mode** for control & commands, and **High-Speed (HS) mode** for pixel data.
* Multiple lanes allow higher bandwidth (like PCIe lanes).

---

### 4️⃣ The Display Panel

* The panel’s **DSI peripheral controller** receives the serial stream.
* It de-packetizes:

  * Reads **DCS (Display Command Set)** commands (brightness, power state, resolution).
  * Reads **video pixel packets** → sends them to **TCON (Timing Controller)** inside the panel.
* TCON drives **row/column drivers** → actual **LCD/OLED pixels light up**.

## ⚙️ Block-Wise Breakdown

### 🧠 Block 1: CRTC

* Reads framebuffer from memory.
* Generates pixel clock, hsync/vsync, and raw RGB data.

### 📦 Block 2: DSI Host Controller

* Packetizes pixels into DSI protocol (short + long packets).
* Adds error checks, aligns with video timing.
* Manages **command vs video mode**.

### 🚄 Block 3: MIPI PHY

* Converts parallel DSI packets into high-speed differential signals.
* Switches between LP (setup/commands) and HS (streaming pixels).

### 🖼️ Block 4: Display Panel

* Receives serial stream, de-packetizes.
* TCON interprets syncs, places pixels line-by-line.
* Pixel drivers energize TFT/OLED elements to show the image.

## 💡 Big Picture Flow (One Line)

**Framebuffer → CRTC → Encoder (DSI Host Controller) → PHY → Display Panel → TCON → Pixels lit**
