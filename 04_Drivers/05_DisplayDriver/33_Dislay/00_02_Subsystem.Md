Yes — that’s a solid plan.

If you follow up the **theoretical explanation of embedded audio/video pipelines** with an actual **V4L2 + GStreamer decoding workflow**, it’ll click much faster for readers.
You can structure it like this:

---

### **1. Theory Recap**

* How embedded boards connect audio/video controllers (I²S for audio, MIPI CSI/DSI or HDMI for video).
* How data moves: hardware DMA → kernel driver → V4L2 API → user space.
* Where GStreamer fits in: pulls buffers from V4L2, decodes, plays.

---

### **2. Practical: V4L2 + GStreamer Command Flow**

**Example:** decoding H.264 camera stream

```bash
# Capture from camera via V4L2, decode in hardware, play to display
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! \
    video/x-h264, width=1280, height=720, framerate=30/1 ! \
    h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! kmssink
```

**Flow:**

1. `v4l2src` → Talks directly to V4L2 device driver.
2. `h264parse` → Aligns stream to frame boundaries.
3. `v4l2h264dec` → Uses SoC hardware decoder via V4L2 M2M interface.
4. `kmssink` → Renders to DRM/KMS display subsystem.

### **3. Why It’s Powerful**

* Shows **hardware acceleration in real-time**.
* Demonstrates **Linux kernel + middleware + user space** working together.
* Gives an interview-ready practical example.

If you want, I can **draw the exact block diagram** showing:
Camera → CSI interface → ISP → DMA → V4L2 buffer → GStreamer → Display.

That would make your series **complete** — theory + code + visuals.

Do you want me to prepare that diagram now?
