# I²C interview Q\&A — detailed answers from scratch

Great — below I’ll answer each tough I²C question from your list in detail, starting at the protocol level and moving into Embedded C and Linux driver design, debugging, performance, recovery, and scenario-based problem solving. I’ll include register-level/pseudocode sketches, ISR flow, timeout/recovery strategies, and practical debugging tips you can use in an interview or on the job.

---

**1) Explain clock stretching — when does a slave stretch the clock, and how should the master handle it?**

**What clock stretching is:**
Clock stretching is the mechanism by which an I²C slave device holds the SCL line low after the master releases it, to indicate the slave is not yet ready to proceed (e.g., it needs more time to process data or prepare the next byte). Because masters generate clock pulses by releasing SCL high, a slave that pulls SCL low delays the next clock edge.

**Why slaves use it:**

* Slave needs time for internal ADC conversion, EEPROM write cycles, or preparing data from a slow internal peripheral.
* Flow control: e.g., slave read buffer empty and needs time to refill.

**How a master should handle it (practical points):**

* **Hardware support:** Most I²C master controllers automatically sample SCL and will wait if SCL is held low (i.e., hardware clock stretching support). If controller lacks support, master must implement stretching handling in software (bit-banged I²C).
* **Timeouts:** Master must not wait forever. Implement a configurable timeout for SCL being held low (e.g., tens to hundreds of milliseconds depending on device). If timeout expires, try recovery (see bus recovery below).
* **Detecting long stretch:** Use bus-level status flags (controller-specific) or measure SCL low duration via timer. Log and optionally inform upper layers that the slave is slow.
* **Multi-master:**
  If another master tries to drive the bus while a slave stretches, arbitration rules still apply — but generally clock stretching is independent and should only affect current transaction.

**Common pitfalls / interview notes:**

* Some SoC I²C controllers do not support clock stretch beyond certain cycles — mention checking the SoC manual.
* Some devices (esp. older/badly-designed ones) stretch indefinitely on error — software must detect and recover.

---

**2) Describe I²C arbitration. How does the hardware detect a loss of arbitration?**

**Arbitration basics:**

* Arbitration ensures only one master continues driving the transfer when multiple masters attempt the bus simultaneously.
* Arbitration occurs bit-by-bit during address/data transfer. Masters drive SDA bits and read SDA. If a master writes ‘1’ but reads ‘0’, it has lost arbitration and must stop driving the bus (become slave/idle).

**How it’s detected (hardware level):**

* Each master samples the SDA line after driving it. If the sampled value ≠ driven value (driving 1 but reading 0), the master lost arbitration. This comparison is typically implemented in the I²C controller hardware and signalled as an arbitration-lost interrupt/status bit.

**Implications:**

* The losing master MUST stop transmission immediately and release SDA/SCL so the winning master can continue.
* Arbitration never corrupts data — the winning master's data is preserved.

**Troubleshooting / gotchas:**

* Arbitration errors can appear with one physical master if line glitches or stuck-low cause master to read a different level.
* EMI or open-drain wiring errors can mimic arbitration loss. Always rule out signal integrity issues.

---

**3) What happens if a master sends a slave address and there is no slave for that address?**

**Address phase outcome:**

* The addressed slave must ACK the 7-bit or 10-bit address during the 9th clock cycle. If no device responds, the master will receive a **NACK** (no ACK). The master should interpret this as “no device present at address” or “device not responding.”

**How driver should handle it:**

* Return a specific error code to upper layers (e.g., `-ENXIO` or `-ENODEV` in Linux, or custom error in baremetal) and possibly retry the transaction a few times if intermittent.
* For Linux user-space callers, you might surface `ENXIO` or `EIO` depending on semantics.
* Avoid busy-waiting on repeated NACKs — use backoff between retries.

**Edge cases:**

* If a device NACKs due to being busy (e.g., EEPROM write internal busy), a retry after the device-specific delay may succeed. Some devices indicate busy via status registers rather than NACK, so read the datasheet.

---

**4) Can an I²C bus support multiple masters? What changes in driver design are required?**

**Yes — multi-master is allowed by the protocol.**

**Driver/stack design implications:**

* **Arbitration handling:** Driver must respond to arbitration-lost interrupts and gracefully stop ongoing transaction.
* **Bus ownership serialization:** Kernel-level adapter drivers usually provide locks to ensure only one logical operation occurs at a time. In multi-master physical setups, the bus MAY be accessed by other masters outside the OS control — your driver must detect arbitration loss and retry.
* **Clock stretching and timing:** Longer contention and clock stretching interactions require careful timeouts.
* **Bus recovery:** More likely to face bus lockups — implement robust recovery sequences.
* **Concurrency:** Use mutexes/waitqueues; implement re-entrant paths carefully.
* **Notifications:** Provide hooks so clients can handle arbitration-loss or retries.

**Hardware support:**

* Confirm the controller implements arbitration detection; if not, multi-master is unsafe.

---

**5) How do you implement repeated START and why is it needed?**

**Repeated START (`Sr`)**:

* A START condition followed by an address without issuing a STOP between transfers. It keeps bus ownership and avoids a bus release that could allow another master to intervene.

**Why it’s needed:**

* Common for combined operations like write-register-then-read-data (e.g., write register address, repeated START, read bytes from that register) without losing bus control or readdressing overhead.
* Ensures atomicity for register read/writes on devices that require contiguous transaction.

**Implementation (embedded C, controller / bit-banged):**

*Pseudocode (polled controller):*

```c
// Controller-specific sequence:
// 1. Write START bit to control register
// 2. Write address+W, perform bytes.
// 3. Instead of issuing STOP, set RESTART bit (controller-specific) or generate START while keeping SDA low
// 4. Send address+R and read bytes
// 5. Issue STOP

i2c_write_reg(I2C_CTRL, START);
i2c_write_data(addr<<1 | 0); // write reg pointer
wait_for_tx_complete();
i2c_write_reg(I2C_CTRL, RESTART); // controller handles repeated start
i2c_write_data(addr<<1 | 1); // read
read_bytes();
i2c_write_reg(I2C_CTRL, STOP);
```

*Bit-banged repeated start (manual):*

* Drive SDA low while SCL high (START),
* After bytes, generate START condition again without issuing STOP.

**Driver note:** Use controller’s repeated-start mode if available, because it’s cleaner and avoids generating STOP/START timings manually.

---

**6) Difference between standard mode, fast mode, fast mode plus, and high-speed mode in I²C**

**Modes and typical clock rates:**

* Standard mode: up to 100 kHz.
* Fast mode: up to 400 kHz.
* Fast-mode Plus (Fm+): up to 1 MHz.
* High-Speed (Hs): up to 3.4 MHz (special master/slave handshake used to enter Hs mode).

**Key differences / engineering implications:**

* **Pull-up strength:** Faster modes require stronger pull-ups (lower R) to meet rise-time requirements; but too strong pull-ups increase power consumption and may violate open-drain drive limits.
* **Bus capacitance & topology:** High-frequency operation more sensitive to capacitance; limit bus length & device count.
* **Controller support:** Not all controllers support Fm+/Hs; double-check. Hs needs special handshaking.
* **Signal integrity:** At higher speeds you must worry about ringing, reflections, and need proper layout.
* **Firmware timing parameters:** Adjust Tlow/Thigh, rise/fall time tolerances, and timeouts.

---

**7) Explain 7-bit vs 10-bit addressing and driver handling differences**

**7-bit address:**

* Most devices use a single 7-bit address; the 8th bit is R/W bit.

**10-bit address:**

* Uses two-byte addressing in the address phase: first byte `11110xx0` with two address bits, second byte carries the remaining 8 bits.
* Controller must support 10-bit addressing mode to generate the two-step address sequence properly.

**Driver handling:**

* In Linux, `i2c_client` contains flags for 10-bit addressing (`I2C_CLIENT_TEN`). Use appropriate APIs.
* Check device tree bindings for 10-bit addresses.
* In bit-banged drivers, implement the two-byte address sequence per I²C spec.

---

**8) Given an SoC’s I²C controller register map, how do you write a polled-mode I²C transaction?**

**High-level steps (polled):**

1. Configure controller (clock dividers, speed, addressing mode).
2. Set target slave address register.
3. For write: put data into data register, start transfer by setting START/GO bit.
4. Poll status register for TX complete or ACK/NACK.
5. On ACK, continue sending bytes; on NACK, abort and return error.
6. At end, set STOP and wait for bus free.

**Polled transfer pseudocode (baremetal):**

```c
int i2c_poll_write(uint8_t addr, uint8_t *buf, int len) {
    i2c_reg->addr = addr;
    for (i=0;i<len;i++){
        i2c_reg->data = buf[i];
        i2c_reg->ctrl = CTRL_START | CTRL_WRITE;
        // poll
        start = get_time_ms();
        while(!(i2c_reg->status & STATUS_TX_DONE)) {
            if (get_time_ms() - start > TIMEOUT_MS) return -ETIMEDOUT;
        }
        if (i2c_reg->status & STATUS_NACK) {
            i2c_reg->ctrl = CTRL_STOP;
            return -EIO;
        }
    }
    i2c_reg->ctrl = CTRL_STOP;
    return 0;
}
```

**Notes:** Use memory barriers or `volatile` for register access. Respect controller-specific flags for RESTART and STOP.

---

**9) How do you handle an I²C transaction timeout in your driver?**

**Timeout strategy:**

* **Configurable timeout** per transfer (depend on device; e.g., EEPROM writes may need tens of ms).
* **Detect** via polling timer or using watchdog timer in the controller.
* **On timeout:**

  * Attempt **graceful abort** via controller STOP/reset sequence.
  * If bus still stuck, perform **bus recovery** (toggle SCL, send STOP via bit-bang, reinitialize controller).
  * Return meaningful error to upper layers and optionally log device address and state.
* **Retries:** Retry a small number of times with exponential backoff if device may be transiently busy. But avoid infinite retries.

**Implementation tip:** Use proper timers (hardware timers or kernel `hrtimer`) to avoid busy-waiting and to allow other tasks to proceed.

---

**10) Explain interrupt-driven I²C transfer flow from ISR to completion**

**General flow:**

1. **Initiation (thread/context):** The driver prepares the transfer, fills data buffer, sets target address and enables interrupts. It then requests the controller to start transfer and sleeps/waits (e.g., waitqueue) for completion.
2. **ISR:** The controller raises an interrupt on events (TX empty, RX full, NACK, arbitration lost, transfer complete). ISR reads status, moves data between FIFO/register and driver buffers, clears interrupt flags, and possibly schedules bottom-half work if more processing needed.
3. **Bottom half / tasklet / workqueue:** For heavier processing (user notifications, retries), defer from ISR to bottom half to keep ISR fast.
4. **Completion:** When last byte handled and STOP observed, ISR or bottom-half wakes the waiting context (completes a `completion` or `wait_event`) with success or error code.
5. **Error paths:** On NACK or arbitration-lost, ISR sets error and wakes waiting thread; driver performs retries or recovery.

**ISR responsibilities:**

* Keep ISR short.
* Do minimal state updates, push/pop FIFOs, and schedule the next transfer chunk.
* Use atomic state or locks if ISR and thread share state.

**Pseudocode:**

```c
// Thread context
setup_transfer();
enable_interrupts();
start_transfer();
wait_for_completion(&transfer_done);

// ISR
irq_handler() {
    status = read_status();
    if (status & STATUS_RX_FULL) {
        buf[pos++] = read_data_reg();
    }
    if (status & STATUS_TX_EMPTY && more_data) {
        write_data_reg(next_byte);
    }
    if (status & STATUS_NACK) {
        transfer_err = -EIO;
        complete(&transfer_done);
    }
    if (status & STATUS_TRANSFER_DONE) {
        complete(&transfer_done);
    }
    clear_irq(status);
}
```

**11) What is the role of FIFO in modern I²C controllers and how do you use it?**

**Why FIFO helps:**

* Reduces interrupt rate by buffering multiple bytes. Improves throughput and reduces CPU overhead.
* Allows DMA integration easily when FIFO supports burst transfers.

**Usage patterns:**

* Fill FIFO up to its watermark, let controller transmit while CPU prepares next chunk.
* Configure FIFO thresholds to generate interrupts only when FIFO is near empty/full.

**Driver considerations:**

* Implement refill logic in ISR or bottom half.
* Respect FIFO depth — avoid overrunning FIFO on writes or underrunning on reads.
* For multi-byte transfers, use FIFO with DMA where possible.

---

**12) How do you implement DMA for I²C?**

**When DMA is useful:**

* For long sequential read/write streams (e.g., reading large sensor blocks), offloads CPU.

**Implementation outline:**

1. Ensure controller supports DMA or has DMA-friendly FIFO.
2. Allocate DMA-capable buffer (physically contiguous or use scatter-gather).
3. Program DMA engine with source/dest addresses, length, and direction.
4. Kick off controller transfer with DMA enabled.
5. Wait for DMA complete interrupt, then confirm I²C transfer complete.
6. Handle partial transfers and fall back to PIO for small transfers.

**Challenges:**

* Some I²C devices require per-byte ACK processing — DMA must be used only if device supports block transfers.
* Bus recovery with DMA can be more complex.

---

**13) Explain Linux I²C adapter-driver-client model.**

**Key components:**

* **I2C Adapter (`i2c_adapter`)** — represents the bus controller (the hardware). Adapter driver implements `algo` methods (e.g., `master_xfer`) to perform transactions.
* **I2C Client (`i2c_client`)** — represents a device on the bus (slave) and is bound to a device driver that handles that specific chip.
* **I2C Driver (`i2c_driver`)** — registers with the `i2c` core and provides `.probe`/`.remove` for matching devices.

**Flow:**

* Adapter registers itself with the I2C core.
* Device tree or platform code populates `i2c_client` entries (addresses).
* When a module for the device name loads, `i2c_driver->probe` is called with `i2c_client`. Driver uses `i2c_smbus_*` or `i2c_transfer` APIs.

**APIs:**

* `i2c_register_driver(&my_driver);`
* `i2c_transfer(adapter, msgs, num);` — low-level, uses `i2c_msg` structures for multi-message transfers (supports repeated start).
* `i2c_smbus_read_byte_data()` — higher-level helpers.

---

**14) How do you register an I²C client driver in Linux?**

**Typical minimal driver skeleton (Linux):**

```c
static const struct i2c_device_id my_ids[] = {
    { "my_chip", 0 },
    { }
};

static int my_probe(struct i2c_client *client,
                    const struct i2c_device_id *id) {
    // allocate, initialize, read chip id etc.
    return 0;
}

static struct i2c_driver my_driver = {
    .driver = {
        .name = "my_chip_driver",
    },
    .probe = my_probe,
    .remove = my_remove,
    .id_table = my_ids,
};

module_i2c_driver(my_driver);
```

* If using Device Tree, ensure `of_match_table` matches compatible string.
* On probe, use `devm_` helpers for resource lifetimes, and `i2c_smbus_*` or `i2c_transfer` for comms.

---

**15) In Embedded C, why do we use `volatile` for I²C register definitions?**

**Purpose of `volatile`:**

* Prevents the compiler from optimizing away reads/writes to memory-mapped I/O registers. Hardware registers may change independently of program flow, so `volatile` ensures every access happens.

**Example:**

```c
volatile uint32_t *I2C_STATUS = (volatile uint32_t *)0x4000_1000;
```

**Pitfall:** `volatile` is not a synchronization primitive — use proper memory barriers/instruction barriers (e.g., `dsb`, `isb`, `wmb`, or kernel macros) when required for ordering.

---

**16) How would you design an I²C driver to support multiple slave devices on the same bus?**

**Design approach:**

* Use one adapter instance representing the bus. For each device: create an `i2c_client` (via DT or platform data) and bind a driver instance.
* Provide per-client context (struct) containing device-specific configuration (address, irq, regmap).
* Use `i2c_transfer`/`i2c_smbus_*` with the correct `i2c_client->addr`.
* Synchronize access to the adapter with mutexes so concurrent users serialize transfers.

**Optimizations:**

* Group transfers to same chip back-to-back (batched) using `i2c_msg` arrays to use repeated start and reduce overhead.
* Expose per-client APIs for upper layers.

---

**17) Bus hangs — SDA stuck low. What could cause this and how do you recover?**

**Causes:**

* Slave holding SDA low indefinitely (stuck in mid-transaction or error).
* SDA line physically shorted to ground or to another signal.
* A device holding SDA low due to reset state or pin mux misconfiguration.
* Controller misconfiguration leaving transceiver in wrong mode.

**Recovery steps (practical):**

1. **Attempt normal STOP:** Reinit controller and issue STOP.
2. **Clock pulsing recovery:** Toggle SCL manually (as GPIO), up to 9 pulses, to clock the slave until it releases SDA (per I²C spec to clock out stray data/ACKs). Then generate a STOP.

   * Many devices with stuck SDA will release after being clocked.
3. **Drive SDA as GPIO:** If SDA still low, try driving SDA high briefly as GPIO to force release (careful: open-drain bus might be violated — only do if you know devices tolerate it).
4. **Power-cycle problem device(s):** If nothing else works, reset/power-cycle the device or bus.
5. **Log and mark bus as failed:** Report to upper layers.

**Pseudocode for clock pulse recovery:**

```c
for (i=0; i<9; i++) {
    set_SCL_gpio(1); delay_us(t_high);
    set_SCL_gpio(0); delay_us(t_low);
    if (read_SDA_gpio() == 1) break;
}
generate_STOP();
```

**Interview tip:** show you know the 9-clock rule: up to 9 pulses to clear a byte/ACK.

---

**18) How to debug intermittent NACK in a noisy environment?**

**Steps to debug:**

* **Scope/logic analyzer capture:** Capture SDA/SCL during failure. Look for noise, spikes, or wrong timings.
* **Check pull-ups:** Ensure correct value for bus capacitance and speed. Too weak -> slow rise times; too strong -> increased power, possible drive stress.
* **Measure bus capacitance:** High capacitance causes slow edges leading to mis-sampling.
* **Lower bus speed:** If errors disappear at lower speed, it's likely signal integrity.
* **Add filtering / series resistors:** Small series resistor at SDA/SCL can reduce ringing and EMI.
* **Check grounding and layout:** Long traces and poor ground return paths cause EMI.
* **Check level shifters or bus buffers:** Faulty level translator may distort signals.
* **Retry logic:** Add robust retries with backoff for transient NACKs.

---

**19) What’s the impact of wrong pull-up resistor value?**

**If pull-up too large (high R):**

* Slow rise times; devices may not reach valid logic high before sampling -> bit errors, effective max speed decreases.

**If pull-up too small (low R):**

* Higher steady-state current when line driven low → increased power dissipation in devices that pull the line low. Could stress device drivers/transceivers and lead to heating or reduced lifetime. In multi-voltage systems, very low R may exceed open-drain driver strength.

**How to choose R:**

* Based on bus capacitance `Cbus` and desired rise time `trise`. Use the RC time constant approx `tr ≈ 0.8473 * R * C` (empirical). For standard I²C timing targets, check I²C spec for maximum allowed rise times per mode and pick R accordingly. Typical values: 1kΩ–10kΩ depending on speed and capacitance; 4.7kΩ common for 100kHz on moderate capacitance.

---

**20) Describe how you would capture and analyze I²C transactions in a running system.**

**Tools & methods:**

* **Logic analyzer:** Saleae, Beagle I²C analyzer, or cheap LA — capture SDA/SCL, decode packets (address/RW, data, ACK/NACK). Best for intermittent/frequent issues.
* **Oscilloscope:** For analog-level issues: ringing, rise/fall times, overshoot.
* **Kernel tracing:** In Linux, enable I²C debug messages (if driver supports) or instrument `i2c` core logging. Use `dev_dbg`, `i2c_transfer` tracing or `tracepoints`.
* **GPIO toggles:** Instrument code to toggle a GPIO at key points to correlate events with logic capture.
* **Bus error counters:** Add counters in driver for NACK, arbitration loss, timeouts to detect patterns.
* **Reproduce with stress tests:** Create repeated transfers to reproduce fail cases under different conditions (temp, EMI).

---

**21) Why might you get arbitration lost errors even with one master present?**

**Possible causes:**

* **Glitches/noise on SDA:** A bit-level glitch can cause the master to read a different SDA than driven.
* **Hardware bug:** Controller spurious behavior or misconfigured pins.
* **Another device driving lines incorrectly:** A slave misconfigured as push-pull instead of open-drain.
* **Level shifter issues:** If level shifter or buffer drives SDA unexpectedly.
* **Cross-talk or ground bounce** causing false reads.

**Investigation:** Use LA to see actual transitions; confirm that only intended driver is pulling lines.

---

**22) How do you verify bus speed using an oscilloscope?**

**Measurements to take:**

* Measure Tlow and Thigh for SCL — compare with expected clock period (e.g., 10 µs for 100 kHz).
* Measure rise time and fall time of SDA and SCL to ensure they meet specs for mode.
* Inspect duty cycle — ensure clock is stable and meets spec.
* Verify data sampling point occurs when SCL stable (typically mid-clock).
* Check SDA stable during SCL high (start/stop conditions), etc.

**Practical tip:** Use LA decoding features to show timestamps and compute effective transfer rates across bursts.

---

**23) If a slave stretches the clock indefinitely, what happens?**

**Behavior:**

* Master waits — if controller implements clock stretching it will remain in a wait state. If indefinitely stretched, master must detect via timeout.

**What driver should do:**

* After timeout, try recovery: abort transfer, attempt clock pulse recovery, reinit controller, or reset slave if possible. Log error and return failure to caller.

---

**24) Have you ever handled an I²C slave that requires transaction delays between bytes?**

**Approach:**

* Read device datasheet for required inter-byte delays. Implement these in driver either by:

  * Using controller features to insert delays (some controllers allow inter-byte delay setting).
  * Software delays: after each byte, wait required microseconds before sending next. Use non-busy waits where possible.
  * Use repeated start with timed waits if device needs internal processing between address/reads.
* For Linux drivers, perform the delay in the driver probe or transfer function when writing to that specific device.

**Example:**

```c
i2c_write_byte(...);
udelay(device->t_delay_us);
i2c_write_byte(...);
```

---

**25) How would you design an I²C transaction queue to handle multiple requests from different threads?**

**Design goals:** concurrency safety, fairness, throughput.

**Components:**

* A queue of transaction requests (`struct i2c_request { i2c_msg msgs[]; completion_t done; }`).
* Mutex protecting queue insertion/removal.
* Worker thread or kernel workqueue that dequeues requests and serially calls underlying `master_xfer`.
* Each request waits on `completion` for result.

**Behavior:**

* Enqueue from multiple contexts (user threads, interrupt contexts via deferred calls) while ensuring atomic insertion.
* Worker picks request, holds the adapter lock, executes transfer, posts completion with result, and services next.
* Implement priority or fairness if certain requests are high priority (e.g., sensor critical path).

**Deadlock avoidance:** Ensure worker context is separate and does not try to sleep on queue ops while holding adapter lock.

---

**26) How do you improve throughput for a slow I²C device without changing bus speed?**

**Tactics:**

* **Batching / bursting:** Combine small reads/writes into a single multi-message `i2c_transfer` with repeated starts to reduce overhead.
* **Use DMA or FIFO optimally:** Reduce CPU overhead and gaps between bytes.
* **Protocol-level optimizations:** Use block read commands supported by the device (e.g., SMBus block read).
* **Offload processing:** Let device prepare larger bursts so fewer transactions are needed.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Use async transfers to avoid blocking critical threads.

---

**27) How do you implement power management in an I²C driver?**

**Aspects:** runtime PM, system suspend/resume.

**Implementation points:**

* Implement `suspend()` / `resume()` callbacks to quiesce device: finish outstanding transfers, put device into low-power state per datasheet, disable IRQs, and reduce clock gating.
* Implement runtime PM (`pm_runtime_enable`, `pm_runtime_get_sync` / `put`) to power on device on-demand and suspend when idle.
* Ensure transactions are not started during suspend; return error or requeue.
* Handle wake-up sources — if device must wake system on event, configure wakeup IRQ and device state.

**Edge cases:** If device firmware requires power-down sequence, ensure it's executed on suspend and reversed on resume.

---

**28) Can I²C be hot-plugged? How do you detect & handle device removal?**

**Hot-plug challenges:** I²C lacks an intrinsic plug-detect line or universal hotplug protocol (unlike USB). Hot-plug is possible but tricky.

**Detection strategies:**

* Use platform-specific mechanisms (GPIO detect pin telling driver device present).
* Periodically probe the device address (but this is intrusive and not recommended).
* Use external enumerator IC or multiplexer that signals presence.

**Handling removal:**

* On detect-of-removal: cancel pending transfers, notify subsystem, free resources.
* On addition: re-probe driver and initialize new clients.

**Driver design:** Make probe/id\_table and DT entries flexible; implement proper error handling for missing device at probe.

---

**29) How do you test I²C bus recovery in software?**

**Testing methods:**

* **Chaos/injection tests:** Force NACKs, force SDA low, or simulate clock stretching in a hardware-in-the-loop setup and validate recovery code.
* **Unit tests:** Mock controller registers and assert recovery path execution.
* **Stress tests:** Run sustained transfers combined with GPIO toggling to emulate noise.
* **Hardware testbench:** Use a test jig that can short SDA low or inject delays to confirm recovery behavior.
* **Fuzzing:** Randomly force interrupts/errors to test state-machine resilience.

## Scenario-based deep answers

**Scenario 1 — Temperature sensor sometimes returns old data. How to debug?**

Steps:

1. Check sensor datasheet for conversion timing; ensure you wait `t_conv` between initiating conversion and reading results.
2. Check whether reading uses repeated start or STOP+START — some sensors require STOP to latch new conversion.
3. Check if device has a “data ready”/status bit — read that before fetching.
4. Capture with logic analyzer: see actual bus sequence and timing.
5. Confirm driver code uses correct register address and correct endianness.
6. If sensor uses buffered mode, ensure you’re reading the latest sample index.

**Scenario 2 — Multiple I²C devices share an interrupt line — how identify source?**

Approach:

* On shared IRQ, in driver ISR: probe each possible device status register (non-intrusive read) to see which device signals an interrupt condition.
* Alternatively, have devices with status registers that preserve reason — read until you find the one with a pending event.
* Minimize bus traffic by reading only likely devices first based on context.
* If multiple devices signal simultaneously, handle them sequentially or in a loop.

**Scenario 3 — Slave takes 50ms to respond, driver timeout is 10ms. How to handle without blocking other devices?**

Design:

* Use asynchronous/non-blocking transfers: submit a transfer and return immediately; a completion callback will handle when done.
* Use a workqueue or a separate kernel thread to wait on long transfers so main threads remain responsive.
* Increase timeout only for that device or that operation; keep default short timeouts for others.
* If device busy often, implement a polling strategy that checks a status register with small periodic checks instead of blocking the bus.

**Scenario 4 — Works at 100 kHz but fails at 400 kHz. First checks?**

Checklist:

1. **Pull-up resistor value:** Increase drive strength (lower R) to meet faster rise time.
2. **Bus capacitance:** Reduce devices/wire length or add bus buffer.
3. **Layout/trace issues:** Check wiring, avoid long stubs.
4. **Controller timing configuration:** Ensure controller clock dividers and rise/fall compensation are set for 400 kHz.
5. **Signal integrity:** Probe with scope for ringing/overshoot.
6. **Level shifters:** Ensure any level translators support 400 kHz.
7. **Device spec:** Verify all slaves support 400 kHz.

    sda_high(); scl_high(); delay_us(t);

### 2) Linux minimal probe + SMBus read

```c
static int my_probe(struct i2c_client *client) {
    int val;
    val = i2c_smbus_read_byte_data(client, 0x00); // chip id register
    if (val < 0) return val;
    // continue init
    return 0;
}
```

## Final practical interview tips & “war stories” to mention

* Always check the controller datasheet for quirks (clock stretching limits, FIFO depth, known silicon errata). Interviewers like examples where you found a controller limitation and worked around it.
* Show that you use a logic analyzer early — it's the fastest route to root cause. Mention specific captures (start/stop timing, NACK patterns).
* Talk about power consumption trade-offs when choosing pull-ups and bus speed — e.g., on battery-powered devices, choose weaker pull-ups and lower speeds.
* Mention using `regmap` in Linux for devices with register maps to simplify bulk reads/writes and caching.
* If you implemented bus recovery in field devices, describe the exact sequence (clock pulses, STOP, reinit, device reset) and how you validated it with stress tests.

If you want, I can now:

* Expand any single answer into an in-depth article (register-by-register with real SoC example), **or**
* Produce a 20-question printed Q/A cheat-sheet PDF for interview prep, **or**
* Create a concrete Linux I²C adapter driver skeleton (complete C file) for a hypothetical controller with polled and interrupt modes.

Which of those would you like next?
