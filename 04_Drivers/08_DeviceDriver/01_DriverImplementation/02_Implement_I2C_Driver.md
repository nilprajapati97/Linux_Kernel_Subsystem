As a **10-year experienced BSP Engineer**, you're expected to design, develop, and debug **Linux device drivers** across multiple hardware blocks for a custom embedded board. Let’s go **deep from scratch** into the **types of drivers you typically implement**, and **how to develop each**, step-by-step.

## 🎯 BSP Engineer Driver Responsibilities

> A BSP engineer integrates all hardware peripherals with the Linux kernel. Your work ensures **device tree**, **drivers**, and **bootloaders** (U-Boot, SPL) are tightly coupled to **board hardware**.

---

## 🚀 Driver Development Flow (Step-by-Step)

Let’s walk through the flow **using an I2C sensor driver** as an example.

---

### 🔹 1. **Understand the Hardware Specs**

* Read the **datasheet** of your hardware (e.g., I2C temp sensor like TMP102).
* Note: I2C address, registers, supported features, voltages, etc.

---

### 🔹 2. **Device Tree Binding (DTS)**

Edit your board’s `.dts` file:

```dts
&i2c1 {
    tmp102@48 {
        compatible = "ti,tmp102";
        reg = <0x48>;
    };
};
```

---

### 🔹 3. **Write the Driver Code**

Location: `drivers/i2c/sensors/tmp102.c` (for example)

#### Skeleton Code:

```c
static int tmp102_probe(struct i2c_client *client, const struct i2c_device_id *id) {
    dev_info(&client->dev, "TMP102 Sensor Probed\n");
    // Initialize chip, read registers
    return 0;
}

static int tmp102_remove(struct i2c_client *client) {
    dev_info(&client->dev, "TMP102 Removed\n");
    return 0;
}

static const struct i2c_device_id tmp102_id[] = {
    { "tmp102", 0 },
    { }
};

MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, tmp102_id);

static struct i2c_driver tmp102_driver = {
    .driver = {
        .name = "tmp102",
    },
    .probe    = tmp102_probe,
    .remove   = tmp102_remove,
    .id_table = tmp102_id,
};

module_i2c_driver(tmp102_driver);
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Kconfig and Makefile Entry**

**Kconfig:**

```kconfig
config TMP102
    tristate "TI TMP102 Sensor Driver"
    depends on I2C
```

**Makefile:**

```makefile
obj-$(CONFIG_TMP102) += tmp102.o
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Compile & Deploy**

* Enable via `make menuconfig` → Device Drivers → I2C → TMP102.
* Build the kernel: `make zImage modules`
* Deploy the updated kernel/modules to your board.

---

### 🔹 6. **Test the Driver**

```bash
dmesg | grep tmp102
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input
```

Use `i2cdetect`, `i2cget`, and `i2cdump` to debug.

---

## 📦 Other Example Drivers

### 📌 GPIO Driver (Interrupt-based)

* Use `gpiolib`, configure via device tree.
* Register IRQ with `request_irq()` and handle edge triggers.

### 📌 MMC/SD Driver

* Implement in `drivers/mmc/host/<your_soc>.c`
* Use `mmc_host_alloc()` and register `mmc_host_ops`.

### 📌 Display Driver

* Implement using DRM or FB framework.
* Panel timings, backlight, and bridge chips.

---

## 📁 BSP-Level Customization

1. **U-Boot Setup**

   * Configure DDR, PMIC, clocks.
   * Set bootargs, support DFU, USB, SD card.

2. **Device Tree (.dts)**

   * Accurately reflect SoC and board layout.
   * Ensure all devices are mapped with correct addresses and IRQs.

3. **Pinmux Setup**

   * Define all functional pins via pinctrl in DT.

4. **Clock & Power Domains**

   * Register regulators and clocks using DT bindings.

5. **Kernel Porting**

   * Select and patch correct `defconfig`
   * Port SoC-specific changes to `arch/arm/mach-<soc>` or `arch/arm64`.

## 🧠 At 10-Year Experience, You Should Be Able To:

* Write board bring-up scripts from scratch
* Write & debug interrupt-safe drivers
* Tune power/performance for peripherals
* Understand ARM architecture, memory maps
* Lead porting of kernel, bootloader, and device tree to a new custom board
