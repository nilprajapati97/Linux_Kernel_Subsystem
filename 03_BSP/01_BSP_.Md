## 1. üîß What is BSP (Board Support Package)?

A **BSP** is a collection of software and configuration files that supports a specific hardware platform. It bridges the gap between the **hardware** and the **operating system kernel**, typically Linux in embedded systems.

### Key Role:

It enables the OS to run on **custom hardware** by providing:

* Initialization code
* Device drivers
* Bootloader support
* Kernel configuration
* Device tree

---

## 2. üß© Relationship between BSP and Device Drivers

* **BSP includes device drivers** as one of its core parts.
* BSP sets up hardware during boot and registers the appropriate drivers with the OS.
* Example: For an I2C temperature sensor on a custom board:

  * BSP includes the I2C controller driver.
  * BSP device tree includes sensor node.
  * Sensor driver handles communication.

## 3. üì¶ Components of a Typical BSP

| Component                      | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bootloader (U-Boot, SPL)**   | Initializes CPU, memory, clocks, and loads the kernel |
| **Device Tree (DTB)**          | Describes the hardware layout to the kernel           |
| **Kernel Configuration**       | `defconfig` tailored to your board                    |
| **Drivers**                    | For board-specific peripherals (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI) |
| **Middleware & Scripts**       | Init scripts, power management setup                  |
| **Root Filesystem (optional)** | Sometimes part of BSP for development images          |

## 4. üß¨ BSP Boot Process (Linux)

```plaintext
[Power On]
   ‚Üì
[BootROM] (from SoC)
   ‚Üì
[SPL (if any)] ‚Äì init DDR
   ‚Üì
[U-Boot] ‚Äì sets up environment, loads kernel + DTB
   ‚Üì
[Linux Kernel] ‚Äì uses DTB to probe devices
   ‚Üì
[Init process] ‚Äì userspace starts
```

## 5. üõ†Ô∏è What are Device Drivers?

Device drivers are kernel modules or static parts of the kernel that:

* **Control hardware**
* Provide APIs or file interfaces to user space
* Handle **interrupts**, **DMA**, **registers**, etc.

### Types of Device Drivers in BSP:

| Type                 | Example                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Character Driver** | UART, ADC, GPIO driver              |
| **Block Driver**     | eMMC, SD card                       |
| **Network Driver**   | Ethernet, Wi-Fi                     |
| **Platform Driver**  | On-chip peripherals (e.g., I2C/SPI) |
| **PCI/USB Driver**   | External devices                    |

## 6. üîÑ How BSP and Device Drivers Interact

* BSP via **device tree** declares hardware (`compatible`, `reg`, `interrupts`, etc.)
* Kernel **probes** the driver based on `compatible` string
* Driver `probe()` function initializes hardware and registers with kernel subsystems

### Device Tree Example:

```dts
i2c@78b6000 {
    status = "okay";
    my_rtc@51 {
        compatible = "nxp,pcf8563";
        reg = <0x51>;
    };
};
```

### Corresponding Driver:

```c
static const struct of_device_id rtc_of_match[] = {
    { .compatible = "nxp,pcf8563", },
    {}
};

static struct i2c_driver rtc_driver = {
    .driver = {
        .name = "rtc_pcf8563",
        .of_match_table = rtc_of_match,
    },
    .probe = rtc_probe,
    .remove = rtc_remove,
};
```

## 7. üß™ Example: Bring-up New Board with Custom I2C Sensor

### Step-by-step:

1. **Hardware Schematic**: Sensor connected to I2C2 on SoC.

2. **Enable I2C Controller in DT:**

```dts
i2c2: i2c@X {
    status = "okay";
};
```

3. **Add Sensor Node in DT:**

```dts
temp_sensor@48 {
    compatible = "mycompany,temp-sensor";
    reg = <0x48>;
};
```

4. **Write or Reuse Driver:**

   * Register `i2c_driver`
   * Implement `probe()`, `remove()`
   * Implement `read()` or sysfs entries

5. **Kernel Config:**

```bash
CONFIG_I2C=y
CONFIG_MY_TEMP_SENSOR=m
```

6. **Build & Deploy BSP Image:**

   * U-Boot + DTB + Kernel + rootfs

7. **Boot and Check Logs:**

```bash
dmesg | grep -i temp
```
