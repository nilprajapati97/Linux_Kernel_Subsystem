Sure! Let's walk through **how the Linux kernel uses the Device Tree**, step-by-step, **from an embedded Linux system developer‚Äôs point of view**, starting from scratch.

## üìå What is Device Tree?

A **Device Tree (DT)** is a data structure for describing hardware that is **not discoverable** (like I2C devices, GPIOs, UARTs, regulators, etc). It's used during kernel boot to **pass hardware details** to the kernel in embedded systems.

---

## üìç Why is Device Tree Needed?

Unlike a PC (which uses ACPI or BIOS for device discovery), embedded boards like ARM-based SoCs (Qualcomm, NXP, TI) **lack automatic hardware discovery**.

So:

* We need to tell the kernel **what devices exist**
* What addresses, interrupts, clocks, regulators, buses they use

This is done using the **Device Tree Blob (DTB)** passed to the kernel at boot.

## üîç Kernel Flow: How It Uses DT

Let's see this **internally**.

### üîπ 1. **Bootloader loads the DTB**

* U-Boot or similar passes the DTB address to the kernel:

```c
// arm64
void __init setup_arch(...) {
    __fdt_pointer = initial_boot_params; // DTB base address
}
```

---

### üîπ 2. **Kernel parses the DTB**

In `start_kernel()`, kernel calls:

```c
setup_arch() ‚Üí early_init_dt_scan() ‚Üí unflatten_device_tree()
```

This:

* Parses the **flat DTB blob**
* Builds **internal kernel structures** (`struct device_node`, etc.)

---

### üîπ 3. **Platform/Bus Setup**

For each enabled node in DT:

* The kernel **matches the "compatible" string** to a registered driver
* Probes the driver using the **platform/device model**

Example:

```dts
&i2c_2 {
  bmi160@68 {
    compatible = "bosch,bmi160";
    reg = <0x68>;
    interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
    interrupts = <23>;
  };
};
```

* Kernel i2c-core registers this device node
* When a driver calls `i2c_add_driver()`, it matches `"bosch,bmi160"` and probes the device

---

### üîπ 4. **Driver Probing and Resource Extraction**

Inside the probe function (e.g., `bmi160_probe()`):

```c
int irq = of_irq_get(dev->of_node, 0);
struct regulator *vdd = devm_regulator_get(&client->dev, "vdd");
```

* Kernel extracts IRQ, GPIOs, clocks, voltages from DT node
* Binds this info to the device

---

## üîß Example Flow: Adding a New Device

Suppose we have an I2C device on I2C bus 1 at address 0x68:

### Step 1: Add in `.dts`

```dts
&i2c_1 {
    accel@68 {
        compatible = "bosch,bmi160";
        reg = <0x68>;
        interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
        interrupts = <42 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
        vdd-supply = <&vreg_l7>;
    };
};
```

---

### Step 2: Compile

```bash
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o yourboard.dtb yourboard.dts
```

---

### Step 3: Boot + Kernel Logs

During boot:

```plaintext
i2c i2c-1: new_device: Instantiated device accel at 0x68
bmi160: probing device...
```

This means:

* DT matched the driver
* Driver got probed
* IRQ, power, etc., are used

---
